    <div>As a Senior Full Stack Developer at BuildASign since 2019, I&apos;ve spearheaded numerous impactful projects. I created a dynamic Next.js product template system that significantly reduced time-to-market for new products. My implementation of a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services modernized our ecosystem, dramatically improving release efficiency. I also led the design and development of an accounts dashboard with OAuth SSO and Stripe integration. Prior to this, at Adjacent Technologies, I delivered a crucial fulfillment dashboard for a major B2B contract and developed a physical records tracking web app that enhanced client workflow efficiency. These experiences showcase my ability to lead complex projects, optimize processes, and deliver tangible business value through innovative web solutions.</div>
