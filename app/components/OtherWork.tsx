    <div>My portfolio showcases several impactful projects. At BuildASign, I developed a dynamic Next.js product template system that reduced new product time-to-market by 89%. I also implemented a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services, improving release efficiency by 93%. Another highlight is the responsive V3 website I built using Next.js and TailwindCSS, optimizing for SEO and reaching 3 million monthly visitors. On the personal front, I'm currently developing Prog Logger, a NextJS-based logistics dashboard for team progression in MMOs. I've also contributed to Lost Ark Helper, a web app that tracks daily and weekly progress in the game. These projects demonstrate my ability to create efficient, user-centric solutions across various domains, from e-commerce to gaming utilities.</div>
